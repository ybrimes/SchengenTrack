    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>By using Schengenigan ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>The App is a personal travel tracking tool designed to help you estimate your usage of the Schengen Area 90/180-day rule. It is provided for informational and planning purposes only.</p>

    <h2>No Legal Advice</h2>
    <p>The App does not provide legal, immigration, or travel advice. The calculations and information provided are estimates and may not reflect the exact interpretation applied by border authorities. Immigration rules can change without notice. You are solely responsible for verifying your travel eligibility with official sources before travelling.</p>

    <h2>No Liability</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any damages, losses, fines, deportation, travel disruption, or other consequences arising from your use of or reliance on the App. You use the App at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>Accuracy of Data</h2>
    <p>The accuracy of the App's calculations depends entirely on the data you enter. The App cannot verify whether your trip dates are correct or complete. Incorrect or missing trip entries will produce inaccurate results.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The App offers optional premium subscriptions ("Schengenigan Pro") billed monthly or annually. Subscriptions are processed and managed by Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Payment is charged to your store account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your device's store settings.</p>

    <h2>Free Tier</h2>
    <p>The free version of the App allows you to track a limited number of trips. Additional features are available with a premium subscription. The developer reserves the right to change the features included in each tier.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, design, and code in the App are the intellectual property of the developer. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse engineer the App.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App at any time. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:yannick.huber@tutamail.com">yannick.huber@tutamail.com</a>.</p>
