    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>SchengenTrack ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All trip data, settings, and preferences are stored locally on your device using on-device storage. No trip data is transmitted to, stored on, or processed by any external server. The App does not have a backend server and does not collect, upload, or share your trip data.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The App offers optional premium subscriptions processed through Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Purchase transactions are handled entirely by Apple or Google. We use RevenueCat to manage subscription status. RevenueCat receives an anonymous app user ID to verify your subscription entitlement. No personal information (name, email, payment details) is shared with RevenueCat or any other third party by the App.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>The App may send local push notifications (trip reminders and weekly summaries) if you enable this feature. These notifications are generated and scheduled entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>Analytics &amp; Tracking</h2>
    <p>The App does not include any analytics SDKs, tracking pixels, advertising identifiers, or third-party analytics services. The App does not track your usage, location, or behaviour.</p>

    <h2>Data You Provide</h2>
    <p>The only data the App processes is what you manually enter: trip names, countries, dates, and notes. This data remains on your device. If you use the CSV export feature, you choose how and where to share that file.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all your data at any time by using the "Reset All Data" option in Settings. Uninstalling the App also removes all stored data from your device.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the App with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:yannick.huber@tutamail.com">yannick.huber@tutamail.com</a>.</p>
